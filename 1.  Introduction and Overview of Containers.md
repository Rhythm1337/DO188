# 1. Introduction and Overview of Containers

# Topic 1 Introduction to Containers

# Containers:
**Container** is a running instance of a **Container Image**.
A **Container Image** is a single file (tarball), loaded with metadata, that has all the files needed by your application.
The **Entry Point** is the command used to start your **Container**, this can be any process.

Technologies Powering Containerization ----> Kernel namespaces, SECComp, SELinux, Control Groups(cgroups).
These are in-built into the linux kernel

**Kernel namespaces:**
It represents a partition or a boundary. For example namespace1 can only access the files, process and memory which is specified in metadata.

**Control Groups(cgroups):**
They help us set limitations with our system resources. For example namespace1 those processes are allowed to access 1GB Memory and 1 CPU.

**SECComp:**
Think of it as a allow and a deny list of those system cores that are going to be allowed from your namespaces.

# End State:
**Container Images:**
- buildah
- ppodman
- prebuilt from registry

**Container RunTime**
- runC
- cri-o
- docker

**Container Management Tools:**
- podman
- docker
- kubernetes
- openshift is a kubernetes distribution

**Where to get container images:**
- registry.redhat.io
- registry.connect.redhat.com
- quay.io (Community Contributed)
- other registries

**Different Between Virtual Machines and Containers**

| Virtual Machines | Containers |
| --- | --- |
| Started from a vm image | Started from container image |
| Image is larger (many GiB) | Image is smaller (~100 Mib) |
| Has boot loaders, kernel, systemd | No boot loaders or kernel, may have systemd to start some system process |
| Has a hypervisor | No hypervisor, uses container engine (docker,podman,etc) |
| Uses few resources | Uses few resources |
| Has low level access to hardware | Has no level access to hardware |
| Lower level access to Hardware | limited access to Hardware |
| More Resources Required | Lightweight and can be rootless |

# Topic 2 Introduction to Kubernetes and OpenShift

# Red hat OpenShift:

**kubernetes**
- storage
- operators
- web console and CLI tools
- api server
- networking
- cri-o
- etcd

Operators:
| Cluster Operators | OpenShift marketplace operators |
| --- | --- |
| Mandatory | Elective |

Containerized Applications --> **Custom Resource Definition(CRD) (User)** <-- Read Specific State --> **Sync(OpenShift Magic)** <-- Current state

| RedHat Core OS | (RHCOS) |
| --- | --- |
| Control Pannel Nodes | Node1 Node2 Node3 |
| Infracture Nodes | Node4 Node5 Node6 |

You must have 3 Control Pannel Nodes in order to have a supported OpenShift Cluster
Infracture Nodes would host infracture applications
Worker Nodes would host normat applications

You can access OpenShift via OpenShift API
You can either use the web console or the CLI interface
