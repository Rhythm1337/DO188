# Topic 1 Choosing a Base Image

**Standard:**
This is the primary UBI, which includes DNF, systemd, and utilities such as gzip and tar.

**Init:**
Simplifies running multiple applications within a single container by managing them with systemd.

**Minimal:**
This image is smaller than the init image and still provides nice-to-have features. This image uses the microdnf minimal package manager instead of the full-sized version of DNF.

**Micro:**
This is the smallest available UBI because it only includes the bare minimum number of packages. For example, this image does not include a package manager.

**Containerfile Instructions:**
- FROM
- CMD
- LABLE
- USER
- ENV
- and more...
